# Go Black Keys
 
 
**The Black Keys** are an American rock duo formed in Akron, Ohio in 2001. The group consists of Dan Auerbach (guitar, vocals) and Patrick Carney (drums). The duo began as an independent act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular garage rock artists during a second wave of the genre's revival in the 2000s. The band's raw blues rock sound draws heavily from Auerbach's blues influences, including Junior Kimbrough, R.L. Burnside, Howlin' Wolf, and Robert Johnson.
 
Friends since childhood, Auerbach and Carney founded the group after dropping out of college. After signing with indie label Alive, they released their debut album, *The Big Come Up* (2002), which earned them a new deal with Fat Possum Records. Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and broad licensing of their songs. Their third album, *Rubber Factory* (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band's profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label Nonesuch Records in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo completed *Attack & Release* (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer Danger Mouse, who subsequently became a frequent collaborator with the band.

Auerbach attempted to make a living from performing at small bars in town, but realized he would not be able to book shows in other cities without a demo. To record one, he asked for help from Carney, who agreed to provide recording equipment and allow his basement to be used if Auerbach recruited the other musicians. However, none of Auerbach's backing band showed up on the recording date.[3] Instead, Carney and Auerbach jammed, eventually leading to the duo forming a band in mid-2001.[3][8] Together, they recorded a six-song demo consisting of "old blues rip-offs and words made up on the spot" with minimal equipment.[3] After sending the demo to a dozen record labels, they accepted an offer in 2002 from a small indie label in Los Angeles named Alive,[5][9] because it was "the only label that would sign [them] without having to see [them] first".[10]
 
According to an interview on NPR's *Fresh Air*, the group's name "the Black Keys" came from an acquaintance diagnosed with schizophrenia, Alfred McMoore. He would leave incoherent messages on their answering machines referring to their fathers as "black keys" such as "D flat" when he was upset with them.[11][12] On March 20, 2002, the duo played their first live show at Cleveland's Beachland Ballroom and Tavern to an audience of approximately eight people.[9] The band's debut album, *The Big Come Up*, was recorded entirely in Carney's basement on an 8-track tape recorder in lo-fi and was released in May 2002,[13] three months after they signed to Alive.[9] The album, a mix of eight original tracks and five cover songs, forged a raw blues rock sound for the group; the covers included tracks originally by blues musicians Muddy Waters, Junior Kimbrough, and R. L. Burnside. Two tracks, covers of the traditional blues standard "Leavin' Trunk" and the Beatles' song "She Said, She Said", were released as a single on Isota Records. The track "I'll Be Your Man" would later be used as the theme song for the HBO series *Hung*. In order to help fund a tour, Auerbach and Carney took jobs mowing lawns for a landlord.[14] Despite modest sales for *The Big Come Up*, it gained a cult following and attracted attention from critics, eventually landing the group a record deal with Fat Possum Records.[15]
 
Within days of signing to Fat Possum, the Black Keys completed their second album, *Thickfreakness*.[6] It was recorded in Carney's basement in a single 14-hour session in December 2002, an approach necessitated because the group spent its small advance payment from Fat Possum on rent.[8][10][16] The group had recorded sessions with producer Jeff Saltzman in San Francisco but ultimately aborted them, as they were unhappy that the results sounded too much like "modern-rock radio".[8] In March 2003, the group played at one of its first music festivals, South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, after driving for nearly 24 hours from Akron.[17] Much as they did for the festival, Carney and Auerbach spent their early tour days driving themselves from show to show in a 1994 Chrysler van they nicknamed the "Gray Ghost".[18]
 
The Black Keys released an EP titled *The Moan* on January 19, 2004, featuring "Have Love Will Travel", an alternate version of "Heavy Soul", and two covers. The group found itself struggling to sell records or gain airplay of their songs on the radio, and they were not making much money either; they had to absorb a $3,000 loss from a European tour.[4] Frustrated with their lack of success, the band relented and decided to begin licensing their music, beginning with the song "Set You Free" in a Nissan automobile commercial.[5] It was the first of an eventual 300-plus song placements in television shows, films, TV commercials, and video games.[21] The group played several high-profile musical festivals in the first half of 2004, including Coachella[26] and Bonnaroo.[27]
 
For their third album, *Rubber Factory*, the band was forced to find a new recording location, as the building that housed their basement studio was sold by its landlord. They created a makeshift studio in a former tire-manufacturing factory in Akron,[22] and recorded from January to May 2004.[28] The album was released on September 7, 2004, and became the group's first record to chart on the US *Billboard* 200, reaching number 143.[29] *Rubber Factory* received critical acclaim and was named one of the year's best albums by *Entertainment Weekly* and *The New Yorker*.[30] Two singles were released, "10 A.M. Automatic" and the double A-side "'Till I Get My Way/Girl Is on My Mind". Comedian David Cross directed the music video for "10 A.M. Automatic".[31] The duo promoted the album with tours in North America, Europe, and Australia.[32] In 2005, the band released their first live video album, *Live*, recorded at The Metro Theatre in Sydney, Australia on March 18, 2005. In July, they played at the Lollapalooza music festival.[33]
 
In 2007, producer Danger Mouse began working on a record for Ike Turner and asked the Black Keys to write a few songs for the project. The collaboration ultimately fell through, and Turner later died in December 2007. The duo decided to turn the material they had written into their fifth studio album, *Attack & Release*, and they asked Danger Mouse to produce the record.[38] The sessions saw the band transitioning away from their "homemade" ethos to record-making; not only was it the first time that the band completed an album in a professional studio,[39] but it was also the first time they hired an outside producer to work on a record.[40] Danger Mouse supplemented the band's sound with instrumental flourishes and more polished production values.[41] Released on April 1, 2008, *Attack & Release* debuted at number 14 on the *Billboard* 200.[15] Four singles were released: "Strange Times", "I Got Mine", "Oceans and Streams", and "Same Old Thing". "Strange Times" was featured in the video games *Grand Theft Auto IV* and *NASCAR 09*. "I Got Mine" is used as the theme song for Canadian police drama TV series *The Bridge*. The song was ranked number 23 on *Rolling Stone*'s list of The 100 Best Singles of 2008.[42]

On October 17, 2008, the Black Keys was an opening act for fellow Akron-area band Devo at a special benefit concert at the Akron Civic Theatre for presidential candidate Barack Obama. Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, also an Akron native and Firestone High School graduate, followed their set.[43] In November, they toured through Europe together with Liam Finn. That month, the group released the concert video *Live at the Crystal Ballroom*, which was filmed on April 4, 2008, at the group's show at Crystal Ballroom in Portland, Oregon. The video was produced by Lance Bangs.[44]
 
Tensions grew within the band in 2009. Prior to Carney's divorce from his wife Denise Grollmus, Auerbach found it increasingly difficult to communicate with the drummer due to his antipathy for Grollmus. Auerbach said, "I really hated her from the start and didn't want anything to do with her."[4] In February, Auerbach released his debut solo album, *Keep It Hid*. Carney, who claimed Auerbach did not tell him about the side project, felt betrayed.[20] Carney subsequently formed the indie band Drummer, with whom he played bass guitar.[45] The group released its debut album *Feel Good Together* on September 29, 2009.
 
The Black Keys reconciled later in the year. On June 6, 2009, they performed along with the Roots, TV on the Radio, Public Enemy, Antibalas, and other acts at the 2nd Annual Roots Picnic on the Festival Pier in Philadelphia.[46] They also joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians' careers.[47][48]
 
*Blakroc*, a collaborative album featuring the Black Keys and several hip hop artists, was released in 2009 on Black Friday. The project was supported and brought together by Damon Dash, who is a big fan of the band. The album features rappers Mos Def, Ludacris, RZA, Raekwon, Pharoahe Monch, Q-Tip, NOE, Jim Jones, Nicole Wray, M.O.P., and the late Ol' Dirty Bastard. The album was recorded in Brooklyn, New York by co-producer, engineer and mixer Joel Hamilton at Studio G. Auerbach said on the official Blakroc site, "Pat and I have been preparing for this record since we were 16."[49]
 
The group's sixth studio album, *Brothers*, was released on May 18, 2010.[51] Recorded primarily at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio, the album was produced by the Black Keys and Mark Neill,[52] and was mixed by Tchad Blake.[53] The song "Tighten Up", the only track from the album produced by Danger Mouse, preceded the album as the lead single. The song became their most successful single to that point, spending 10 weeks at number one on the Alternative Songs chart and becoming the group's first single on the *Billboard* Hot 100, peaking at number 87.[54] The song also reached gold certification status.[55] The music video for "Tighten Up", directed by Chris Marrs Piliero,[56] won the 2010 MTV Video Music Award for Breakthrough Video.[57] *Brothers* sold over 73,000 copies in the US in its first week and peaked at number three on the *Billboard* 200, their best performance on the chart to that point.[58] In total, the record sold 1.5 million copies worldwide,[59] including 870,000 copies in the US,[60] and it was certified double-platinum in Canada, platinum in the US, and gold in the UK.[55] The Black Keys were among several artist judges at the 9th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.[61]
